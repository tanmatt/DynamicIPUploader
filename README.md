#dynamic_IP_notifier
Most of my cronjobs run on a server.
The server doesn't have a static IP (I don't want to spend money on it.)
Yet, I need to know the public IP to ssh into it. 
This program solves the problem of changing IP by sending text message with new IP. 

Just put your cell number in the script and you are ready to use the script. 
I have created a cronjob to run this script every hour and if there is IP change, I will get text message.
